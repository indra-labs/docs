# Indra Routing Protocol White Paper

Onion routed distributed virtual private network protocol with
anonymised payments to create scaling incentives.

[David Vennik](mailto:david@cybriq.systems) September 2022

## Abstract

The state of counter-surveillance technologies has remained largely unchanged in
the 20 years since the inception of the [Tor network](https://torproject.org).

The primary use case has always been obscuring the location information of users
from clearnet sites, and the more it has been used for this purpose, the more
hostile clearnet sites have become towards this network, due to its frequent use
to launch attacks on web services.

With the increasing amounts of value being transported in data packets on the
Internet since the appearance of the Bitcoin network, the need for eliminating
the risks of geographical correlation between payments and user locations
continues to rise.

However, without any way for users to pay routers without creating an audit
trail, the anonymising networks have not grown in nearly a decade, and
thus well heeled attackers have largely been able to keep pace and pluck off
high value targets, such as
the [Carnegie Mellon University](https://blog.torproject.org/did-fbi-pay-university-attack-tor-users/)
- implicated in part of what led
to the arrest of the Silk Road founder, Ross Ulbricht.

It is the central thesis of this paper to demonstrate how obfuscating
correlation between payments and session usage can be achieved and create a
marketplace in routing services which can economically increase to a size that
is beyond the capabilities of a state sized actor to fund an attack, while also
improving latency and stability of routed connections.

## Tor Isn't Scaling, But Bitcoin Needs Onion Routing

For comparison, this is Bitcoin's node count:

Versus Tor in a comparable period:

It is not hard to see:

- Tor is not growing, it has flatlined.

- Bitcoin is growing.

Not only that, you can also see that onion routing is forming an increasingly
large component of Bitcoin connectivity.

## Goals of Indra Routing Protocol

Three key elements of the Tor protocol make it less than desirable in general.

1. Establishment of circuits is quite slow, taking a large number of steps
   to "telescope" into a circuit.

2. Once a circuit is running, when it fails, the failure is opaque to the client
   side, and there is no way to provide a latency guarantee or connection
   stability. It is unsuitable for interactive and long living connections.

3. There is no profit motive to drive expansion of router
   capacity.

Tor is a poor solution for a very limited subset of of the use cases that
benefit from the security of route obfuscation. Indra aims to provide what Tor
has definitely now failed to achieve for a large majority of internet users:
location privacy.

## Anonymised Session Purchase Protocol

The initial purchase of a routing session presents a chicken and egg situation.
Without an existing circuit, how does a client node acquire tokens for sessions
with onion routers to use for
creating hops in an onion route?

For this, we borrow
from Lightning Network
protocol [BOLT#4](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/04-onion-routing.md)
which we cannot use by itself as it has no provision for returning an arbitrary
package of data, nor the notion of an interacting midpoint in the loop, with the
path going back to the sender.

As distinct from this `lightning-onion` protocol, we use ed25519 for signatures
and curve25519 for the ECDH key exchange, and encrypt traffic with AES-GCM. Rolling over the cipher is done via hash chains on sequential packets, which constitute the unit of transmission. As noted later, this is 8 Kb, a moderate size but not too small to accommodate a substantial message with no return packets embedded.


### Session Tokens

Session tokens are an arbitrary random value that must be present in the header
of encrypted data and is hashed in a chain to provide a counter for the packet
sequence within a session, which are combined with the public key of the router
to generate the cipher for a packet. This cipher changes as the session
progresses by hashing the previous value matching the accounting of the packets
in the session.

### Exit Sessions and Charging

When packets are delivered at the exit point, the node then encrypts the return
message with the provided cipher which is carried back according to the
instructions of the next hop, back through two nodes before reaching the client.

The return message indicates the number of packets that have been consumed by
the session. These should be congruent with the exit nodeâ€™s advertised exit data
rate or scheme.

#### Protocol Specifics

In order to prevent spam, different protocols have different rules. For Bitcoin,
for example, the transaction must be valid, and the fee must be within 50%
variance of the current fee rate in the mempool, or similar specifications. The
router can charge equal fee to the embedded fee in the transaction, or a factor,
as the privacy premium. This is then computed against the main data rate by a
factor.

To enable this, there may need to be a simple specification for complex
requirements that relate to the relayed messages in the exit protocol. Usually a
Bitcoin transaction will fit into one packet comfortably, so the immediate
return message will signify the satoshis charged as a proportion of the fee rate
for the advertise bandwidth.

Similarly, for Lightning, there can be message related fee rate calculations,
for lightning, more simple, the router can simply state a fee rate in the same
way as clearnet routers. This will be charged to the channel operators, not the
carried transactions, so the operators will add this privacy premium to their
routing fees on the connection path in addition to their routing fee.

### Path Hop Acknowledgements

In order to ensure the session purchase protocol is properly executed, in each
layer of the onion there is special acknowledgement onion messages carrying the
payment receipt that confirms delivery, and route backwards to the buyer, who
knows then that a hop has succeded.

In this way the buyer can expect 5
acknowledgements to be successful and then receive the session key from the 5th
node in the circuit.

The acknowledgement onions are constructed so that nodes do not know what step
they are, so each has space for 5 steps, which are masked using methods as
described in BOLT#4.

If the 5 acknowledgements are not received within a reasonable time, the buyer
then propagates forwards payment reversals up to the last acknowledged payment,
reversing the payment and denying the misbehaving node where the route stopped.

#### Session Purchase Fees

These are not charged as relay packets, the cost is amortised with the per hop
fee paid to propagate the payment forward. Each hop gets a fee, and the fee paid
is dictated by the node operator, and is a threshold parameter for the buyer.
Nodes will not be chosen to do the purchase if they advertise purchase fees
above this threshold. This can be considered to be a question of anonymity set
size, rather than a concrete threshold, a proportion of offered rates,
representing the relative proportion of nodes that could be selected and process
the payment.

## Source Routing

As distinct from TOR, Indra uses source routing, thanks to the magic of the
session tokens and ECDH, means that in the event of a route path failing, a new
path can be generated with a changed set of intermediate routers when a timeout
occurs.

### Latency Guarantee and Path Timeout Diagnostics

For time sensitive interactive applications, these progress detecting onions be
used at every step to ensure the moment one hop latency exceeds a prescribed threshold the
source routing algorithm can then swap out a different node in the route and thus provide a
strong latency guarantee.

Some applications are very time sensitive. Real-time interactive shared
environments such as games can have very serious consequences (to the players)
when their connection starts to increase in latency putting them at disadvantage
against their opponents, and in general, a sluggishness of the interactivity.

Long lived sessions like SSH also can become tiresome when running over Tor when
inevitably congestion or downtime hits a hop in the path. For applications where
a few seconds stall do not disrupt the protocol, activating path timeout
diagnostic onion acknowledgement packets enables the client to determine which
hop needs to be replaced.

For additional security, a user can configure the return onions to return via
random, multi hop paths, rather than reversing the forward path.

#### Acknowledgement Charging

These acknowledgements are essentially reverse onion paths like the forward
paths, but only 3 hops each, and with a small payload. They are essentially
charged one packet each, per hop, to maintain the flat packet size and eliminate
packet size fingerprinting. The client thus can consume as much as 5 packets per
forward packet in charges for a path traced transmission, as well as the fees on
the exit, for path tracing or high reliability guarantee transmission.

### Circular Paths

One of the key inventions of Indra is the notion of circular paths. These are
two hops out to the exit/destination point, and two hops backwards, on a
different path, for
the return.

By using this circular topology, the source can provide a return path that is
not the same as the forward path, and when the path timeout diagnostics are not
in play, there is no visible reverse path confirmation timing for large scale
network traffic analysis.

That is to say,
the packets appear to always only be going forward, and no correlation is easily
made between, therefore, forward, or reverse paths, which is not the case with
telescoped TOR protocol packets, and for most general purposes in Indra are
avoided when traffic achieves the intended forward path without excessive
latency.

The return paths also serve as a path to return a new cipher for an exit node,
whose messages are carried with the return loop, as well as bandwidth accounting
data, via provided ciphers for the return path payload.

Return paths are also used by the exit node to return a value indicating. the
number of packets charged out of the exit session (which includes at least one
for their return relay)

### Packet Sizes

All packets are 8 Kb in size. Acknowledgement onions increase overhead and
reduce data that can be carried. Routers charge for the total payload. By making
packets uniform, it is a simple matter of counting packets, and thus the
hash-chain counters directly relate to total routed traffic volume.

### Liveness

Because of the circular path and the reverse path after the middle carrying
return messages, communication must always be prompted by the client in order
for ongoing return messages to occur.

This has a bearing on bandwidth charges, in that each onion sent out will deduct
session bandwidth from 5 separate nodes. Bandwidth is really quite cheap, in
general, so, it is not really onerous. A person offering relay services on their
node probably ends up earning as much as they use, depending on how much
bandwidth they proscribe for their own use outside of the service, and depending
on the charge regime of the provider (if it is metered or flat charge per time).

Indra uses UDP, eliminating any session overhead, the path
acknowledgements and return paths are already defined in the onion packets. TCP
and QUIC can be carried across the circuits, as will often be the case for
hidden services. Indra aware services can take advantage of the knowledge of the
protocol and trigger features of the protocol such as return acknowledgements
and the return hops to carry things like acknowledgements of packets received
via their hash fingerprint.

There is no need for
negotiating connections, data is simply forwarded around on the basis of
pre-agreed contracts of service created by the purchase of data sessions, and
authenticated by valid headers, which prove relation to the session root code.

This messaging strategy does require a constant request/reply pattern, but a
node does not need to send a second request unless the response does not come
back within an expected time window, or is expected to have some amount of
delay, because the return path is already plotted, and the cipher provided to
the exit hop in the circuit.

For some applications, this is fine, such
as a terminal session, as while the user is not asking for anything, the
listener does not either have to wait for anything. For this type of traffic
there can be pings, which are short packets and do not need path diagnostics, so
they are cheap for monitoring liveness.

In addition, nodes monitor the state of other nodes in the clear when gossiping
status updates and advertisements, and if the (uncharged) traffic of asking for
status updates from peers reveals a node is
unresponsive this is a back channel that can be used to trigger a circuit path
change to route around a dead router.

## Funding model for Indra developers

One of the problems with open source projects is that it can be difficult to find sufficient funds to pay for the maintenance of the software. In order to provide an income stream that can fund this development, it becomes possible that a set of nodes are designated in the delivered binaries that can be required in a 3rd hop in purchases to charge a proportion, something like 1%, maybe less if traffic volumes are very large.

In this way, these funds can be accumulated and used to maintain the software and improve it.
